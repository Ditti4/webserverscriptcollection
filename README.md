webserverscriptcollection
=========================

Little collection of some scripts to easily manage domains and virtual hosts. Made for apache2 and nginx but feel free to modify it to your own needs.

And wow, after one year of no working on this at all I finally decided to upload this. "Why did it take you so long?" you may ask. I could give you some of those default excuses like "life got busy" or something but the thing is that I have no clue what held me back for so long.  
So sorry if anyone on Google ever tried to find the scripts in this repository (though I doubt that) and sorry they are written like they are written. They are terrible and I feel bad for releasing them into the wild but I don't plan to work on them anymore so why not release them, even if they're unfinished? Better than nothing, right?  
Anyway, have fun with them and feel free to submit issues or pull requests or something. Maybe I'll get around and continue working on them at some point in the future but currently there aren't any plans for that.

### Setup

Just modify the scripts to your own needs. You need to edit some of the placeholders in the etc/default files and some of the variables in the scripts, the rest should, or better, *may* work out of the box.

### Usage
./*domain domainname
./*vhost domainname vhostname
